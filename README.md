# AI-Racing-Sim

Welcome to the **Car Racing AI Game** project! This project is built using Python, Pygame, and Gymnasium. It features a car racing game with AI-controlled cars navigating through randomly generated race tracks. The AI cars are currently under development and will be capable of driving autonomously once trained.

## Features

- **AI Cars**: The game is focused on developing AI cars that can navigate race tracks autonomously using reinforcement learning.
- **Random Track Generation**: Each game session generates a new, random race track, ensuring a unique experience every time.
- **Smooth Gameplay**: Built using Pygame, the game offers realistic car behavior and visual feedback.
- **Customizable**: The project is open-source and easy to customize, making it suitable for further development and experimentation.
