# Car Racing AI Game

Welcome to the **Car Racing AI Game** project! This project is built using Python, Pygame, and Gymnasium. It features a car racing game with AI-controlled cars navigating through randomly generated race tracks. The AI cars are currently under development and will be capable of driving autonomously once trained.

## Features

- **AI Cars**: The game is focused on developing AI cars that can navigate race tracks autonomously using reinforcement learning.
- **Random Track Generation**: Each game session generates a new, random race track, ensuring a unique experience every time.
- **Smooth Gameplay**: Built using Pygame, the game offers realistic car behavior and visual feedback.
- **Customizable**: The project is open-source and easy to customize, making it suitable for further development and experimentation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Pygame
- Gymnasium
- NumPy
- PyTorch
- StableBaselines3

Comand to install all Prerequisites :

```bash
pip install pygame gymnasium numpy torch stable-baselines3
```

## Use Cases

1. **AI Development and Testing**: 
   - Experiment with AI training scripts to develop autonomous driving behavior. 
   - Observe how the AI models adapt to randomly generated tracks, providing insight into their learning process.

2. **Game Development Learning**: 
   - Explore how Pygame and Gymnasium are used together to build dynamic game environments.
   - Understand the integration of reinforcement learning models into game mechanics.

3. **Random Track Generation**: 
   - Developers can enhance and modify the track generation algorithms to create more varied and complex racing environments.
   - Track customization can be used to test different AI driving behaviors and strategies.

4. **Reinforcement Learning Experimentation**: 
   - Use the project as a sandbox to apply different reinforcement learning techniques.
   - Experiment with training parameters, reward systems, and learning algorithms to improve the AIâ€™s racing skills.
